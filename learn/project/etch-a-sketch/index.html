Dear Ms. Smith,

My name is Hadrian Lau and I am a grade 10 student at DSC International School. I am a passionate programmer that generally loves exploring and learning how things work (also trying new things!). 

Growing up drawing control panels, tinkering with Linux, an open source operating system, became one of my hobbies. I mainly use NixOS as my Linux distribution and I use Arch before. For my tiling manager (or desktop environment), I use hyprland, which offers customization from ground up. 

I am currently learning web development (full-stack dev) for building progressive web apps, electron apps, and react native apps. I use The Odin Project as my fullstack guiding curriculum where I learn technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, TS, React, NextJS, NodeJS, and postgreSQL. As a web development enthusiast, I have a website: hadrianlau.com (https://hadrianlau.com) and did some practice projects like etch-a-sketch (https://hadrianlau.com/learn/project/etch-a-sketch) and a porodomo timer that I made 2 days ago (https://hadrianlau.com/porodomo)

Aside from learning, I am working as a front-end developer at elevate-educate.net (remote) and organzing a student-ran engineering hackathon called https://scrapyard.hk (hosted in march!). 

In addition, I also love doing competitive programming and math competitions and enjoys the process of problem solving. Since I use C++ for competitive programming, I also build CLI utility apps like judge and ossdmk. More statistics on https://hadrianlau.com/portfolio. 

When I do too much computer stuff, I love walking around anyplace near my current location as I found it very relaxing. Beside I sim race and watch formula one usually at night and cooking meat and noodle dishes in the weekends. 

If this isnâ€™t obvious enough lol, I aspire to be a software engineering and entrepreneur in the future. 

I want to get 90% in this course and gain new skills to level up as a student. I want to know how different companies, organizations, and events operate too. 

Thank you!

Sincerely,
Hadrian
